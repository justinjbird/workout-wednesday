# Workout Wednesday

## What is this?

Repository containing completed modules for Workout Wednesday Power BI challenges. I'm late to the party so I plan to complete 2-3 a week if I can.

## Completed modules

### 2021 Week 1 | Power BI: Connecting To & Modeling Data

#### Requirements

- Because this is the first ever #WorkoutWednesday Power BI style, we are going to start simple. The first few challenges are going to build on one another, so keep this in mind as we start out the year.
- Create cleaned data set with only teams from the Football Bowl Division. In order to do this, in the FBS Conferences field exclude the FBA Totals and null values.
- Within NCAA Subdivision, remove all Conference Medians
- Create data model properly relating two dim tables to the fact table.
- Try and use as least amount of steps as possible.

#### Revisions

Inaccuracies in the spec, so complete requirements are;

- Filter "FBS Total" and null values from "FBS Conference" column
- Filter "Conference Median" from "NCAA Subdivision" column

#### Steps

- Set filter for FBS Conference
- Set filter for Conference Median
- Promoted headers on conference_dim

## Notes

- I'm working through these modules on a Mac. That means jumping through a few hoops. I'm running Power BI Desktop via [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/uk/).
